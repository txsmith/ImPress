/**
 * This package contains all interfaces and classes necessary
 * to store and retrieve information from HBase.
 *
 * The interfaces set the boundaries of what you have to do,
 * so look at them and read their JavaDoc!
 *
 * The code as given already works so you can run it and get
 * an idea of how things should work, but...
 * Currently every bit of user data is stored in memory, so
 * when you terminate the application server, all your data
 * will be lost!
 *
 * The assignment is to fix this by giving all DAO interfaces
 * an implementation that uses HBase.
